Option 2 - Southern Study Group Scheduler
An app that helps students form and schedule in-person or virtual study groups by subject and availability.

Objective
The Southern Study Group Scheduler aims to address a common challenge faced by Southern Connecticut State University (SCSU) students by providing a specialized digital platform that fosters convenience, connection, and efficiency. This project was motivated by student needs that are currently underserved by general-purpose platforms or social media, particularly where trust, local context, and cost are important.

Potential Users and Usage Scenario
The platform targets SCSU students, faculty, and staff who are seeking streamlined access to university-centered services or collaboration. For instance, a student may want to quickly find a peer to trade textbooks with, while another may be looking for academic partners for an upcoming group project. Faculty or administrators can use the platform for oversight and community moderation. Usage will range from short-term interactions to recurring long-term collaborations, depending on the app’s focus.

User Needs
SCSU students need secure, reliable ways to exchange information and resources, find peers for shared goals, and track their activity. The proposed application will fulfill these needs by creating a campus-specific, intuitive, and responsive interface. Trust, simplicity, and flexibility are key drivers behind the design choices.
